# Noxcap

In all honesty, we probably could've finished pacxon if we had started earlier.
However, with two days left before the deadline, we thought it best to create a
backup game in the event we didn't finish. The original repo for the backup is
https://github.com/MGRiv/projectbackup. To run the backup, please open page.html.
